LEO-Dictionary-Quick-Search-Pop-up
==================================

Easiest and fastest way to look-up a word in LEO dictionary for Google Chrome browser.

Description
===========

This extension was inspired by the original [LEO Dictionary](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leo-dictionary/dhmlplceigplahbkhifeaeinaeppccef). This extension, however, had the shortcoming that it framed pda.leo.org which does not give the search input field an autofocus attribute. Thus each time you open the pop-up you have to set the cursor manually into the search field. 

I found this annoying and thus decided to create this extension which frames the default dict.leo.org.

I hope you find this extension useful and useable. If you have any feedback, please write me a mail to [orschiro at gmail dot com] or file a request on [Github](https://github.com/orschiro/LEO-Dictionary-Quick-Search-Pop-up).


Usage
=====

First [download](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leo-dictionary-quick-sear/bfjfdobcmlpnafcnbkpgklaidojpmjhh) the extension from the Webstore. Click on the LEO lion icon in the icon bar in the upper right corner. The pop-up will open and will quickly allow you to look-up a word.
